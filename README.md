# findingpairs
Given an array as input and a target value, the program would find pairs of numbers that belong to the array which whose difference equals to the target value.
The first line of input should contain the array and then the target value. The input pattern must match the following-
[2, 3, -4, 6, 1] //input array, elements separated by a space and comma
2 //target value
Output: 1 -> [3,1]
